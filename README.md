# CFA-Lambtown

## Problem

In this project, we had to create a blog type system that is used for the inhabitants of Lambtown to posts their thoughts and feelings about living there!

The aim was to test our knowledge of how to login in with the use of various social media sites like Facebook (Omniauth gem). Later on we experimented with added roles (Rolify) to the application. We added an admin role that can view all the posts of a user and delete users. We also created a Trello board for user stories as part of agile methodologies.

## Challenges

Overall the functionality of the app is working without any bugs - however it is quite simple and does only a few things! Designing while creating the logic is tricky for me at the moment as I find it hard to finish projects in time if I focus on them both and hence I only focused on the functionality on this project and that is why the design looks sub-par!

### That's it for now folks!
